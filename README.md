This was a simple React/Redux blog project based off Stephen Griders Udemy course on React/Redux. It uses Stephens API with a unique key added to the
end of the url(See http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/). I added a few things to it as it's my first attempt at using Redux with React. 
If you're interested in more see the links below to get started.
